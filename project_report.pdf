# Travel-Tide Customer Segmentation Project Report

## 1. Problem Statement and Data Preparation

### Problem Statement
The travel app currently experiences a low conversion rate among browsers who don't make purchases. Our goal is to design targeted perks to increase conversion rates from the current baseline to 20% by attracting potential customers through personalized incentives.

### Data Preparation
- **Initial Dataset**: PostgreSQL database containing user, session, flight, and hotel data
- **Filtering Criteria**: 
  - Users with >7 sessions since January 4, 2023
  - Removed outliers in spending and session metrics
  - Validated data quality (negative values, missing data)
- **Final Dataset**: ~6,000 users with complete behavioral profiles

## 2. Feature Engineering

### Core Metrics Development
1. **Monetary Metrics**:
   - Total spend (flights + hotels)
   - Average booking value
   - Customer lifetime value

2. **Behavioral Metrics**:
   - Session frequency
   - Session duration
   - Click-through rates

3. **Discount Utilization**:
   - Discount frequency
   - Average discount amount
   - Distance-adjusted discount score

### Composite Scores
1. **Bargain Hunter Index**:
   - Combines discount frequency, amount, and distance sensitivity
   - Normalized to 0-1 scale
   - Weighted based on behavioral significance

2. **Customer Value Score**:
   - Monetary value (40%)
   - Booking frequency (30%)
   - Session engagement (30%)

## 3. Segmentation Methodology

### Approach Selection
- Initially tested clustering (K-means)
- Switched to rule-based approach for better interpretability
- Validated using silhouette score and business logic

### Segment Definitions
1. **Platinum (10%)**:
   - High total spend (>75th percentile)
   - Low discount sensitivity
   - Highest conversion potential

2. **Gold (10%)**:
   - High total spend (>75th percentile)
   - High discount sensitivity
   - Strong response to price incentives

3. **Silver (30%)**:
   - Medium spend (25th-75th percentile)
   - Mixed discount behavior
   - Moderate conversion potential

4. **Bronze (50%)**:
   - Lower spend (<25th percentile)
   - Price-sensitive browsers
   - Requires significant incentives

## 4. Perk Assignment Strategy

### Perk Types
1. **Premium Support**:
   - Minimum spend: $5,000
   - Minimum bookings: 5
   - Weight: 30%

2. **Priority Booking**:
   - Frequency score threshold: 0.7
   - Weight: 20%

3. **Discount Access**:
   - Discount score threshold: 0.6
   - Weight: 25%

4. **Loyalty Bonus**:
   - Monetary score threshold: 0.8
   - Weight: 25%

### Assignment Rules
- Fuzzy logic implementation
- Score-based eligibility
- Segment-specific combinations

## 5. Validation and Results

### Metric Validation
- Silhouette score: 0.42
- Segment stability analysis
- Cross-validation of rules

### Expected Impact
- Current conversion: 10%
- Projected conversion: 15-20%
- Segment-specific improvements:
  - Platinum: +15%
  - Gold: +12%
  - Silver: +8%
  - Bronze: +5%

### Implementation Recommendations
1. Phase rollout by segment
2. A/B testing of perk combinations
3. Continuous monitoring of conversion rates
4. Quarterly review and adjustment

## 6. Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- Modular Python scripts
- Automated pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation
- Version control integration

### Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for core functions
- Data validation checks
